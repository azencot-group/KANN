# KANN: Koopman Analysis of Neural Networks

KANN is a collection of python utilities for the analysis of neural networks.
This code shows highlighting of positive and negative words (unigrams)
using the dominant eigenvectors of the Koopman operator

* To install the package, run the following:
python setup.py --install

* Then, you can run the notebook notebook/sa_task_example.ipynb
