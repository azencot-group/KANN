# An Operator Theoretic Approach for Analyzing Sequence Neural Networks (KANN)

KANN (Koopman Analysis of Neural Networks) is a collection of python utilities for the analysis of neural networks.
This code reproduces some of the experiments from our paper [An Operator Theoretic Approach for Analyzing Sequence Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.07824.pdf).

## Code

We provide code for understanding the dynamics of trained RNNs through Koopman operator analyses.

* To install the package, run the following:
python setup.py --install

* Then, you can run the notebook notebook/sa_task_example.ipynb
